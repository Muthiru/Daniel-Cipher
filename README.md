# Daniel-Cipher

This implementation follows the classic Feistel structure while adding its own:
Custom S-box for substitution
Custom P-box for permutation
Unique key schedule algorithm
Addition-based key mixing
The strength of this cipher relies on:
The cryptographic properties of the S-box
The permutation pattern of the P-box
The key scheduling algorithm
The number of rounds
